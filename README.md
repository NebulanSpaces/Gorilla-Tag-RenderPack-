GORILLA TAG THUMBNAIL RESOURCES!

Tutorial: (Soon)

Things to know:
- There is 3 expression png's in the blender file hidden by default, you can turn them on if needed!
- Backgrounds are for adding in, use GIMP/Photoshop for that
- Don't Forget to Add Textures to Cosmetics! (Note: Cosmetics are now included!)
----Adding Map/Rig----
- Drop the GorillaTag_[Update Name Here].blend OR GorillaBase.blend into the render, click append. go to collections

(If Appending GorillaBase) Go to Collections and select Gorilla_IK_Rig
(If Appending GorillaTag_[Update Name Here]) Go to Collections and select whatever, PLEASE NOTE: if you select everything in the collections area, note that it may take a little while.

- I would recommend you append GorillaBase to the map, instead of the other way around! Thanks.
